Drama
===
In order to curb drama induced by the De-Anonymization from phex chat, we may require parties that are in conflict to agree to seize a topic or event for the sanity of non involved parties. If the topic/event is brought up again and/or a party does not make the needed accommodations for an agreement of de-escalation, action may be taken against the accounts.
